This involves researching a technology that recognizes the characteristics of passengers and functions performed in autonomous vehicles, and presents suitable modalities (interaction methods for input and output for task execution) to allow users to achieve their desired objectives. The goal of this research is to improve the stability and usability of in-vehicle interfaces for autonomous vehicle passengers by designing a technology that encourages interaction based on the characteristics and goals of passengers. <br> <Strong>'Responsive Multimodal Interface’</Strong> consists of <br><Strong>1) 'Modality Selection Technology,'</Strong> which determines the optimal interaction method based on passenger characteristics and target functions, and <br><Strong>2) 'Affordance Design Technology,'</Strong> which guides passengers to interact through the selected modality.",

	"abstract": "This study aims to investigate the relationship between perceptual image quality, affective image quality, and user preference for smartphone camera photos. A semantic scale consisting of four perceptual (‘color’, ‘exposure’, ‘noise’, ‘texture’) image qualities and eight affective (‘trendy’, ‘vivid’, ‘natural’, ‘bold’, ‘soft’, ‘warm’, ‘blueish’, ‘yellowish’) image qualities were defined through literature review and text-mining. Participants evaluated preferences, perceptual quality, and affective quality for the photos displayed on smartphones. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis showed that all perceptual qualities are significant determinants of preference. In affective qualities, ‘trendy’, ‘vivid’, ‘natural’, ‘bold’, and ‘yellowish’ were predictors of user preferences. Finally, ‘color’, ‘exposure’, and ‘texture’ had positive correlations with ‘trendy’, ‘vivid’, ‘natural’, and ‘bold’. This study presented two perspectives that could help improve users' preferences for smartphone photos. Additionally, the user survey method used in this study could make it efficient to investigate the preference for smartphone photos.",
